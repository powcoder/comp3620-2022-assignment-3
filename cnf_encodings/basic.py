""" This file contains the methods you need to implement to create a basic
    (non-split) encoding of planning as SAT.

    You can work your way through the exercises below to build up the encoding.

    We strongly recommend that you test as you go on some of the smaller
    benchmark problems.

    Here is a simple example to run the problem on the smallest Miconics
    instance:

    python3 planner.py benchmarks/miconic/domain.pddl benchmarks/miconic/problem01.pddl miconic1 4

    You might want to implement the plan extraction method after you implement
    the method to create the CNF variables. You will then be able to generate
    (probably incorrect) plans as you add more constraints.

    To test the fluent mutex axioms and reachable action axioms you will need
    to turn on the plangraph computation "-p true".

    Remember, it is relatively easy to figure out where you have gone wrong if
    the SAT solver finds invalid plans. For example if the plan validator
    indicates that an action has an unsatisfied precondition, then there is
    probably something wrong with your precondition clauses or your frame
    axioms. However, if the SAT instance is unsatisfiable, then you will likely
    have to start removing constraints to figure out where you went wrong.

    To help you debug your encoding, you can use the argument "-d true" to
    write an annotated CNF file with the clauses you are generating. Warning:
    Looking through this for large problems will be nearly impossible, so test
    on the small instances.

    Sometimes SAT encodings of planning problems can end up BIG because there
    are just so many actions. Either use the argument "-r true" or clear out
    your tmp_files directory periodically and manually.

    This system is designed to run on either Linux or Mac machines. This is
    unavoidable because we need to call and run external grounding and SAT
    solving programs.

    This software will NOT work on Windows. We suggest using a virtual machine,
    or working in the labs if you do not have a linux installation.

            Exercise 1 - 5 Marks

            The method self.new_cnf_code(step, name, object) will return an int
            representing a new CNF variable for you to use in your encoding.

            Let k be the horizon which is passed as a parameter. Use the above
            method to make one variable for each Proposition at each step 0..k
            and one variable for each Action at each step from 0..k-1.

            Access the actions and propositions from the lists
            self.problem.actions and self.problem.propositions.

            Use str(proposition) to get name of a proposition and str(action)
            to get the name of an action when calling self.new_cnf_code.

            For object, you should just pass either the Proposition or Action
            object.

            So, self.new_cnf_code(4, str(a), a) will create a new variable and
            return a code (an int) representing the CNF variable for action a,
            at step 4.

            Since you will need to use these variables to make your constraints
            later, you should store them in self.action_fluent_codes and
            self.proposition_fluent_codes.

            These should map each (Action, step) pair and each (Proposition,
            step) pair to the appropriate code.

            Once you have made the variables, you can get the step, name, and
            object (Action or Proposition) with the following:
               - self.cnf_code_steps[code]
               - self.cnf_code_names[code]
               - self.cnf_code_objects[code]

            You shouldn't need to use these until you come to extract the plan
            generated by the SAT solver, but they might be useful for
            debugging!

            which must be true are in self.problem.pos_initial_state and the
            Propositions which must be false are in
            self.problem.neg_initial_state.

            Every Proposition in the problem will be in one of these two sets.

            Also add clauses which ensure that the goal holds at the horizon.
            Similarly to the start state, the goal clauses are in
            self.problem.goal.

            Not every Proposition will be in the goal. The truth values of
            other Propositions should remain unconstrained.

            positive and negative literals) using the variables you created
            for Q1. Get the variables from self.proposition_fluent_codes).

            Two actions a1 and a2 interfere if there is a Proposition p such

            action is not executed before the first step it is available in

            Exercise 8 - 5 Marks

            In this method, add clauses to the encoding which ensure that pairs
            of propositions cannot both be true at the same time. These
            constraints are computed when the plangraph is generated.

            These clauses are not required for correctness, but usually make
            planning faster by causing the SAT solver to backtrack earlier.

            The dictionary self.problem.fluent_mutex maps integers representing
            planning steps to lists of proposition mutex relationships at each
            step from 1...n, where n is the step that the plangraph levels off.
            Note that the dictionary doesn't contain steps greater than n,
            because the relationships at step n also hold for every step
            greater than n. Thus you can get those mutex relationships by
            querying the dictionary with step n.

            You can get n by getting the largest key in
            self.problem.fluent_mutex maps.

            It is possible that the current horizon is less than n. In this
            case, mutex relationships larger than the horizon should, of
            course, be ignored.

            As the initial state clauses completely determine the truth values
            of fluents at step 0, there is no need for fluent mutex clauses
            there.

            Each list of mutex relationships in self.problem.fluent_mutex will
            be as follows:

              [(f1, f2), ....]

            Say, we have (f1, f2), then there should be a clause [-f1, -f2]
            (obviously substituting the appropriate CNF codes for f1 and f2,
            depending on the step.

            Add clauses with self.add_clause(clause, clause_type).

            In your clauses use the variables from
            self.proposition_fluent_codes.

            These clauses have the type "fmutex".

    def build_plan(self, horizon: int) -> None:
        """Build a plan from the true variables in a satisfying valuation found

           Exercise 9 - 5 marks

           self.true_vars is a set with the codes of the CNF variables which the
           SAT solver has set to true in the satisfying valuation it found.

           You can get the step, name, and object (Action/Proposition) of each variable
           (state or action fluent) with:
               - self.cnf_code_steps[code]
               - self.cnf_code_names[code]
               - self.cnf_code_objects[code]

           You can check if an object is an Action or Proposition with
               - isinstance(obj, Action) and
               - isinstance(obj, Proposition)

           You should add the plan to self.plan, which has the structure
           [action_list, action_list, ...].

           For each step t = 0..k-1, it has a (possibly empty) list of the
           actions which were executed at that step.

           So, if we have a0 and a1 at step 0 and a2 at step 2, then self.plan

           where a0, a1, a2, etc. are Action objects (not just their names).
