# COMP3620/6320 Assignment 3: Planning

This is the GitLab repository for COMP3620/6320 Assignment 3. To get started:

1. Click the `Fork` button at the top of the page to fork the repo.
2. If asked for a namespace, choose your name.
3. As you go through the assignment, push changes regularly to your forked
   repo. The files we expect you to change are the following:
   - `basic.py`
   - `logistics_control.py`
   - `report.pdf`
   - `run_experiments.py` or `run_experiments.sh`

The deadline for Assignment 3 is **Friday 27 May at 6pm**. To submit the
assignment, you simply need to make sure that you have pushed all of your
answers before the deadline. You must not push any more commits after the
deadline has passed.

Remember that the marks you receive for the assignment depends on many factors,
such as correctness, efficiency, code documentation, code readability, using
appropriate data structures, and elegance of the solutions.

For all of the assignments in this course:

- **You can import ONLY the following packages**: argparse, collections, copy, datetime,
  functools, glob, heapq, itertools, json, logging, math, matplotlib,
  multiprocessing, random, numpy, operator, os, pandas, pathlib, platform,
  pickle, pprint, queue, re, string, subprocess, sys, time, typing.
- Any other package (for instance, scipy, networkx, etc) is **NOT ALLOWED**.
